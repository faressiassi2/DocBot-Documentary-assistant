So, \\nlet’s move on! \\nProgramming Languages & Software Employed in Data Science - All the Tools You \\nNeed \\nAlright! So… \\nHow are the techniques used in data, business \\nintelligence, or predictive analytics applied \\nin real life? \\nCertainly, with the help of computers. \\nYou can basically split the relevant tools \\ninto two categories—programming languages \\nand software. \\nKnowing a programming language enables you \\nto devise programs that can execute specific \\noperations. Moreover, you can reuse these \\nprograms whenever you need to execute the \\nsame action. \\nAs you can see from the infographic, R, and \\nPython are the two most popular tools across \\nall columns. Their biggest advantage is that \\nthey can manipulate data and are integrated \\nwithin multiple data and data science software \\nplatforms. They are not just suitable for \\nmathematical and statistical computations. \\nIn other words, R, and Python are adaptable. \\nThey can solve a wide variety of business \\nand data-related problems from beginning to \\nthe end. \\nOf course, R, and Python do have their limitations. \\nThey are not able to address problems specific \\nto some domains. One example is ‘relational \\ndatabase management systems’—there, SQL \\nis king. It was specifically created for that \\npurpose. SQL is at its most advantageous when \\nworking with traditional, historical data. \\nWhen preparing your BI analysis, for instance, \\nyou will surely employ it. \\nOkay. \\nWhen it comes to data science, mentioning'),\n",

While respectable, \\nMATLAB usage is a paid service, and that’s \\none of the reasons why it is losing ground \\nto open-source languages like R and Python. \\nEither way, R, Python, and MATLAB, combined \\nwith SQL, cover most of the tools used when \\nworking with traditional data, BI, and conventional \\ndata science. \\nWhat about big data? \\nApart from R and Python, people working in \\nthis area are often proficient in other languages \\nlike Java or Scala. These two have not been \\ndeveloped specifically for doing statistical \\nanalyses, however they turn out to be very \\nuseful when combining data from multiple sources. \\nAll right! Let’s finish off with machine \\nlearning. \\nWhen it comes to machine learning, we often \\ndeal with big data. Thus, we need a lot of \\ncomputational power, and we can expect people \\nto use the languages similar to those in the \\nbig data column. Apart from R, Python, and \\nMATLAB, other, faster languages are used like \\nJava, JavaScript, C, C++, and Scala. \\nCool. \\nWhat we said may be wonderful, but that’s \\nnot all! \\nBy using one or more programming languages, \\npeople create application software or, as \\nthey are sometimes called, software solutions, \\nthat are adjusted for specific business needs. \\nTheir smaller scope does not make them less \\nuseful, in fact, just the opposite—they \\nare a lot easier to learn and be adopted by \\nothers.
